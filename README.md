## Setup lavender for AOSP-Quack based rom

* Download supported sources (LineageOS, AOSCP, RR, etc...) (this source is suited best for EvolutionX and AEX, you will have to modify it for other ROMs)
* Once this is downloaded, clone this repo to .repo/local_manifests then sync again
* Run . build/envsetup.sh
* Launch your build (brunch aosp_lavender-userdebug, aosp can change depending on the target rom)
