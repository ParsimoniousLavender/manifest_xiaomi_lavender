## Setup lavender for EvolutionX Elle

* Download EvolutionX sources from here: https://github.com/Evolution-X/manifest/tree/elle-aosp
* Once this is downloaded, clone this repo to .repo/local_manifests then repo sync again
* Run . build/envsetup.sh
* Launch your build (brunch evolution_lavender-userdebug) and go off to do something, this is going to take a while :)
* Transfer over the finished build (found in out/target/product/lavender) to your phone, flash and enjoy!
